20.2. SETTING ACCESS ACLS



There are two types of ACLs: access ACLs and default ACLs. An access ACL is the access control list for a specific file or directory. A default ACL can only be associated with a directory; if a file within the directory does not have an access ACL, it uses the rules of the default ACL for the directory. Default ACLs are optional.
ACLs can be configured:


	
	Per user
	
	
	Per group
	
	
	Via the effective rights mask
	
	
	For users not in the user group for the file
	


The setfacl utility sets ACLs for files and directories. Use the -m option to add or modify the ACL of a file or directory:

# setfacl -m rules files

Rules (rules) must be specified in the following formats. Multiple rules can be specified in the same command if they are separated by commas.


	u:uid:perms
	
	Sets the access ACL for a user. The user name or UID may be specified. The user may be any valid user on the system.
	
	g:gid:perms
	
	Sets the access ACL for a group. The group name or GID may be specified. The group may be any valid group on the system.
	
	m:perms
	
	Sets the effective rights mask. The mask is the union of all permissions of the owning group and all of the user and group entries.
	
	o:perms
	
	Sets the access ACL for users other than the ones in the group for the file.
	


Permissions (perms) must be a combination of the characters r, w, and x for read, write, and execute.
If a file or directory already has an ACL, and the setfacl command is used, the additional rules are added to the existing ACL or the existing rule is modified.

Example 20.1. Give read and write permissions

For example, to give read and write permissions to user andrius:

# setfacl -m u:andrius:rw /project/somefile


To remove all the permissions for a user, group, or others, use the -x option and do not specify any permissions:

# setfacl -x rules files


Example 20.2. Remove all permissions

For example, to remove all permissions from the user with UID 500:

# setfacl -x u:500 /project/somefile
